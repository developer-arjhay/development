			"title": "Google Search is getting a new voice",
			"description": "The janky, robotic voice of Google Search results that we’ve all come to know and love – at least in U.S. English – is being retired. Google is rolling out a new, smoother and less disjointed voice for spoken search results, as you can hear in the video below.\n\nThe more natural intonation and fluid delivery are much more life-like and the “gaps” between words are almost impossible to hear. It seems to be a server-side Google Text-to-Speech engine change, because the Play Store is not showing any available updates and nor are the latest APKs of Google TTS and the Google app.\n\nIf you’re not using U.S. English as your default and want to see if you have the new voice (or you just want to check out other accents), go to Settings > Language and input > Text-to-Speech output > Settings > Language to choose your system language. If necessary, go to Install voice data and choose a language pack to download.",

			"description": "Google has said that it will extend Android Pay to the UK in the next few months.\n\nThe facility allows any device running Android 4.4 or higher and fitted with an NFC (near field communication) chip to act as a tap-and-pay substitute for credit and debit cards.\n\nSeveral lenders, including Lloyds Bank, HSBC and Nationwide have said they will support the scheme.\n\nSamsung earlier said its rival service would also come to the UK this year.\n\nThe South Korean handset maker has yet to be more specific about its British launch plans for Samsung Pay, which is restricted to its own Android smartphones.\n\nApple Pay has been available in the UK since July 2015 but is limited to the firm's iOS devices, so will not compete directly with Google's service.",
