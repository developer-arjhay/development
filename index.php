			"description": "Samsung is looking to reform its working culture in a bid to foster innovation. With the smartphone segment plateauing, the South Korean manufacturer has announced that it will embrace startup culture, eschewing the top-down hierarchy it currently follows.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Samsung said:\n\nWe aim to reform our internal culture, execute as quickly as a startup company and push towards open communication and continuously innovate.\n\nSamsung also mentions that the move will foster a dialogue between division heads and employees, as well as cutting down on internal meetings, simplifying reporting procedures, and creating better work-life balance for employees. However, it may take some time for the manufacturer — which employs over 300,000 people worldwide — to make tangible strides in this direction.\n\nIn the meantime, Samsung has launched an in-house incubator that lets employees <b>nurture their own creative business ideas</b>. Called Creative Lab, the division is responsible for products such as rink, a hand-motion VR controller that can be used with the Gear VR. More recently, C-Lab came up with the Entrim 4D headphones, which give you a sense of motion while viewing VR content by delivering electric signals to your inner ear.",

			"description": "Google has said that it will extend Android Pay to the UK in the next few months.\n\nThe facility allows any device running Android 4.4 or higher and fitted with an NFC (near field communication) chip to act as a tap-and-pay substitute for credit and debit cards.\n\nSeveral lenders, including Lloyds Bank, HSBC and Nationwide have said they will support the scheme.\n\nSamsung earlier said its rival service would also come to the UK this year.\n\nThe South Korean handset maker has yet to be more specific about its British launch plans for Samsung Pay, which is restricted to its own Android smartphones.\n\nApple Pay has been available in the UK since July 2015 but is limited to the firm's iOS devices, so will not compete directly with Google's service.",

			"title": "Google Search is getting a new voice",
			"description": "The janky, robotic voice of Google Search results that we’ve all come to know and love – at least in U.S. English – is being retired. Google is rolling out a new, smoother and less disjointed voice for spoken search results, as you can hear in the video below.\n\nThe more natural intonation and fluid delivery are much more life-like and the “gaps” between words are almost impossible to hear. It seems to be a server-side Google Text-to-Speech engine change, because the Play Store is not showing any available updates and nor are the latest APKs of Google TTS and the Google app.\n\nIf you’re not using U.S. English as your default and want to see if you have the new voice (or you just want to check out other accents), go to Settings > Language and input > Text-to-Speech output > Settings > Language to choose your system language. If necessary, go to Install voice data and choose a language pack to download.",
